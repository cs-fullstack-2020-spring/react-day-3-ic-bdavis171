# React Day 3 IC

Create a react app called `furniture-supplier-app`. Create a class based component called `Furniture`. In the `Furniture` component render `<h1> This is a list of our furniture</h1>` and two child components `Chairs` and `Tables`. In the `Chairs` component define an array of three types of chair. Iterate through the array, rendering the chair element as a p tag. In the `Tables` component define and array of three types of tables. Iterate through the array, render each table element as a p tag. In both child components print `The child has mounted` using a lifecycle method.
